What is Extraction?

Extraction is the process of retrieving data from various sources, which can include databases, files, APIs, or other data repositories. The goal of extraction is to gather the necessary data that will be transformed and loaded into a target environment for downstream use cases like ML, dashboards, or reporting.

This includes configuring access to data sources, writing queries or scripts to pull the data -> web scraping, API calls, or reading files - maybe static files or streaming data.


What is Transformation?
Transformation is the process of converting extracted data into a format suitable for analysis or storage. This can involve cleaning the data (removing duplicates, handling missing values), aggregating it (summarizing data), or reshaping it (pivoting tables, changing data types). The goal is to prepare the data so that it meets the requirements of the target system or application.
1. Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting errors, filtering.
2. Data Aggregation: Joining, Feature engineering, Summarizing data, calculating averages, totals, or other statistics.
3. Data Reshaping: Pivoting tables, changing data types, and restructuring data to fit the target schema.

What is Loading?
Loading is the final step in the ETL process, where the transformed data is written to a target system, such as a data warehouse, database, or data lake. The goal of loading is to make the data available for analysis, reporting, or other downstream applications. This can involve inserting new records, updating existing ones, or overwriting data in the target system.

ETL into Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Data Marts - could be OLAP or OLTP systems.

OLTP - Online Transaction Processing - Write intensive, CRUD heavy, ACID, highly normalized for data integrity.
OLTP systems are designed for managing transaction-oriented applications. They are optimized for high transaction throughput and low latency, making them suitable for day-to-day operations of businesses. OLTP databases typically handle a large number of short online transactions, such as order entry, financial transactions, and customer relationship management. Write Intensive. CRUD operations are common, and the data is often highly normalized to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.

OLAP - Online Analytical Processing- read intensive, complex quries, denormalized for performance.
OLAP systems are designed for complex queries and data analysis. They are optimized for read-heavy workloads, allowing users to perform multidimensional analysis of business data. OLAP databases typically handle large volumes of historical data and support complex aggregations, calculations, and reporting. They are often used in data warehousing and business intelligence applications. Read Intensive. Data is often denormalized to improve query performance and facilitate faster data retrieval.

Expand on temrminologies like data warehouse, data lake, and data mart.

Data Lake: Modern self-serve data storage solution that allows for the storage of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at scale. Data lakes are designed to handle large volumes of data and provide flexibility in terms of data ingestion and processing. They support various data formats and can be used for advanced analytics, machine learning, and real-time processing.

Give a detialed comparision of ETL vs ELT  w.r.t Big data support, flexibility, scalability, and transformation complexitym, use cases, and processing order and time to insight.

ETL vs ELT - both are engineering methodologies / strategies for data processing and integration, but they differ in the order and approach to data transformation and loading.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are two different approaches to data integration and processing.

ETL is usually used for specific use cases, for structured data for on-prem systems. Flexibility and scalability are limited. ETL has its own place. In ETL, data is extracted from source systems, transformed into a suitable format, and then loaded into a target system, such as a data warehouse or database. The transformation step is performed before loading the data, which means that the data is cleaned, aggregated, and reshaped before it is stored in the target system. This approach is often used for structured data and is suitable for traditional data warehousing scenarios.

While transformations are basic in ETL, they can be more complex, dynamic and flexible in ELT. Extract, load and then transform (in a self-service manner) in the target system, such as a data warehouse or data lake. This allows for more complex transformations and processing to be performed on the data after it has been loaded, leveraging the computational power of modern data platforms. ELT is a natural evolution of ETL. How? Staging area

Extraction and loading is done in parallel and asynchronously. Usually for large volumes of data. Big data and computing. This is becuase you can scale up compute on cloud on demand, as compared to on-premise systems where you have to scale up storage and compute separately. ELT is suited for flexibility, scalability and speed, especially in big data environments where large volumes of data need to be processed quickly and efficiently. Its an emerging trend in data engineering, especially with the rise of cloud-based data platforms and big data technologies.

Transformation happens after the data is loaded (on demand and as needed, real-time, ad-hoc), decoupling the transformation process from the extraction and loading steps. This allows for more agility, versatility and flexibility in how data is transformed and processed, as well as the ability to leverage the computational power of modern data platforms.
