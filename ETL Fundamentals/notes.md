# Introduction to Data Pipelines

## What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a series of data processing steps that orchestrate the movement of data from one system to another. It enables organizations to reliably extract data from various sources, transform it to fit operational needs, and load it into target systems for analysis, visualization, or further processing.

## The ETL Process

### What is Extraction?

Extraction is the process of retrieving data from various sources, which can include databases, files, APIs, or other data repositories. The goal of extraction is to gather the necessary data that will be transformed and loaded into a target environment for downstream use cases like ML, dashboards, or reporting.

This includes configuring access to data sources, writing queries or scripts to pull the data -> web scraping, API calls, or reading files - maybe static files or streaming data.

#### Extraction Methods:
- **Full Extraction**: Extracting the entire dataset each time
- **Incremental Extraction**: Extracting only new or modified data since the last extraction
- **Logical Extraction**: Extracting data based on logical conditions
- **Physical Extraction**: Direct extraction from physical storage

#### Extraction Tools:
- **Apache NiFi**: For data ingestion from various sources
- **Fivetran**: Automated data pipeline tool for SaaS applications
- **Airbyte**: Open-source data integration platform
- **Custom Scripts**: Python/SQL scripts for specific extraction needs

### What is Transformation?

Transformation is the process of converting extracted data into a format suitable for analysis or storage. This can involve cleaning the data (removing duplicates, handling missing values), aggregating it (summarizing data), or reshaping it (pivoting tables, changing data types). The goal is to prepare the data so that it meets the requirements of the target system or application.

#### Transformation Operations:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting errors, filtering.
2. **Data Aggregation**: Joining, Feature engineering, Summarizing data, calculating averages, totals, or other statistics.
3. **Data Reshaping**: Pivoting tables, changing data types, and restructuring data to fit the target schema.
4. **Data Enrichment**: Adding additional information from other sources
5. **Data Validation**: Ensuring data meets quality standards
6. **Data Standardization**: Converting to consistent formats (dates, currencies, etc.)

#### Transformation Tools:
- **Apache Spark**: For large-scale data processing
- **dbt (data build tool)**: SQL-first transformation tool
- **Pandas**: Python library for data manipulation
- **Azure Data Factory**: Cloud-based data integration service
- **AWS Glue**: Serverless ETL service

### What is Loading?

Loading is the final step in the ETL process, where the transformed data is written to a target system, such as a data warehouse, database, or data lake. The goal of loading is to make the data available for analysis, reporting, or other downstream applications. This can involve inserting new records, updating existing ones, or overwriting data in the target system.

#### Loading Methods:
- **Batch Loading**: Loading data in scheduled batches
- **Stream Loading**: Continuous loading of data as it arrives
- **Bulk Loading**: High-performance loading of large datasets
- **Incremental Loading**: Loading only new or changed data

#### Loading Considerations:
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data is loaded correctly and completely
- **Performance**: Optimizing loading for speed and efficiency
- **Failure Handling**: Managing and recovering from loading failures
- **Scheduling**: Determining when to load data

## Data Storage Systems

### OLTP vs OLAP Systems

#### OLTP - Online Transaction Processing
OLTP systems are designed for managing transaction-oriented applications. They are optimized for high transaction throughput and low latency, making them suitable for day-to-day operations of businesses. OLTP databases typically handle a large number of short online transactions, such as order entry, financial transactions, and customer relationship management.

**Characteristics:**
- Write-intensive workloads

#### Data Mart
A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a specific business line, department, or subject area. Data marts are designed to provide specialized and relevant data for specific business users, making it easier for them to access and analyze the data they need.

**Characteristics:**
- Subject-specific
- Smaller in size than data warehouses
- Faster query performance
- Department-focused
- Often built from a data warehouse

**Examples:**
- Finance data mart
- Marketing data mart
- Sales data mart
- HR data mart
- Customer service data mart

## ETL vs ELT Methodologies

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are two different approaches to data integration and processing.

### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

In ETL, data is extracted from source systems, transformed into a suitable format, and then loaded into a target system. The transformation step is performed before loading the data, which means that the data is cleaned, aggregated, and reshaped before it is stored in the target system.

**Characteristics:**
- Transformations occur in a dedicated transformation engine
- Optimized for structured data
- Better for compliance and data privacy (sensitive data can be filtered before loading)
- Traditionally used with on-premises data warehouses
- Transformations are predefined and rigid

**Use Cases:**
- When data requires significant cleaning before loading
- When working with limited computing resources
- When data privacy is a major concern
- For structured data with predictable schemas
- Legacy systems integration

**Tools:**
- Informatica PowerCenter
- Talend
- Microsoft SSIS
- IBM DataStage
- Oracle Data Integrator

### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)

While transformations are basic in ETL, they can be more complex, dynamic and flexible in ELT. In ELT, data is extracted from source systems, loaded into the target system, and then transformed within the target system. This allows for more complex transformations and processing to be performed on the data after it has been loaded, leveraging the computational power of modern data platforms.

**Characteristics:**
- Transformations occur within the target system
- Better suited for large volumes of data
- More flexible transformation approach (transform as needed)
- Takes advantage of cloud scalability
- Enables self-service data transformation

**Use Cases:**
- Big data processing scenarios
- Cloud-based data platforms
- When raw data access is valuable
- When transformation requirements change frequently
- Advanced analytics and machine learning pipelines

**Tools:**
- Snowflake
- Google BigQuery
- Amazon Redshift Spectrum
- dbt (data build tool)
- Apache Spark on Databricks

### Detailed Comparison: ETL vs ELT

| Aspect | ETL | ELT |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Processing Order** | Extract → Transform → Load | Extract → Load → Transform |
| **Time to Insight** | Longer - data must be transformed before analysis | Shorter - raw data available immediately, transform as needed |
| **Big Data Support** | Limited - transformation layer can become bottleneck | Excellent - leverages target system's processing power |
| **Flexibility** | Less flexible - transformations are predefined | More flexible - transformations can be defined and modified on demand |
| **Scalability** | Limited by transformation layer | High - leverages cloud computing resources |
| **Transformation Complexity** | Limited by ETL tool capabilities | Supports complex transformations using SQL, Python, etc. |
| **Storage Requirements** | Lower - only transformed data is stored | Higher - both raw and transformed data are stored |
| **Data Governance** | Easier to implement at transform stage | More challenging, requires governance on raw data |
| **Best For** | Structured data, predefined use cases | Big data, evolving use cases, exploratory analysis |
| **Cost Model** | Higher upfront cost, lower storage cost | Lower upfront cost, higher storage cost |

ELT is a natural evolution of ETL, particularly suited for cloud environments. The key differences include:

**Staging Area Approach:**
In ETL, a staging area is used temporarily during the transformation process.
In ELT, the data lake or warehouse itself serves as the staging area, where raw data resides permanently.

**Parallel Processing:**
Extraction and loading in ELT are often done in parallel and asynchronously, especially for large volumes of data. This is possible because you can scale up compute resources on-demand in cloud environments, as compared to on-premise systems where scaling storage and compute separately is more challenging.

**Transformation Timing:**
In ELT, transformation happens after the data is loaded (on-demand and as needed, real-time, ad-hoc), decoupling the transformation process from the extraction and loading steps. This allows for more agility, versatility, and flexibility in how data is transformed and processed, as well as the ability to leverage the computational power of modern data platforms.
