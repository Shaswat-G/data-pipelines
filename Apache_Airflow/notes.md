# Apache Airflow

## Introduction

Open-source (great support community) platform for orchestrating complex computational workflows (DAGs). It lets you build and run workflows.

Note: Airflow is not a workflow engine, it is a workflow orchestrator. And, it is not a data streaming solution.

## Main Principles and Features

### Core Principles

Apache Airflow is built around several fundamental principles that guide its design and functionality:

1. **Dynamic**: Airflow pipelines are configured as code, allowing for dynamic pipeline generation and programmatic construction.

2. **Extensible**: Easily define your own operators, executors, and extend the library to fit the level of abstraction that suits your environment.

3. **Elegant**: Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parameterizing your scripts becomes a natural extension of the configuration as code paradigm.

4. **Scalable**: Airflow has a modular architecture using a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers.

### Key Features

1. **Pure Python Workflows**: Define your workflows in pure Python, making them maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

2. **Rich Command Line Utilities**: Control and monitor your workflows from the command line interface.

3. **Comprehensive Web UI**: Monitor, schedule, and manage workflows through an intuitive user interface.

4. **Extensive Integration Ecosystem**: Out-of-the-box integration with various platforms and services including:

   - Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
   - Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Data processing frameworks (Spark, Hadoop, etc.)
   - Messaging systems (Slack, Email, etc.)
   - Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)

5. **Secure**: Implements robust security features including:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Secure connection handling
   - Integration with enterprise authentication systems

### Common Use Cases

1. **ETL/ELT Processes**: Orchestrate extract, transform, load (ETL) or extract, load, transform (ELT) workflows to move and process data between systems.

2. **Data Warehouse Operations**: Schedule and manage data warehouse refresh, aggregations, and maintenance tasks.

3. **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Coordinate feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment processes.

4. **Report Generation**: Automate the creation and distribution of business intelligence reports.

5. **Infrastructure Management**: Schedule and monitor infrastructure provisioning, updates, and maintenance tasks.

6. **API Orchestration**: Coordinate complex sequences of API calls with dependencies and error handling.

7. **Cloud Resource Management**: Manage cloud resources lifecycle including provisioning, scaling, and teardown.

## Architecture

Apache Airflow's architecture consists of several key components that work together to provide robust workflow orchestration:

### Core Components

1. **Scheduler**

   - Monitors all tasks and DAGs
   - Triggers task instances once their dependencies are complete
   - Submits tasks to the executor to run
   - Handles task retries and backfills
   - Runs as a service that determines which tasks need to be run when

2. **Metadata Database**

   - Central repository for Airflow's state
   - Stores DAG runs, task instances, variables, connections, and configurations
   - Supports multiple database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
   - Maintains historical execution data for analytics and monitoring
   - Enables the web server to display the current state of all workflows

3. **Workers/Executors**

   - Execute the tasks assigned by the scheduler
   - Various executor types available:
     - SequentialExecutor: Runs one task at a time (default with SQLite)
     - LocalExecutor: Runs tasks using parallel processes on a single machine
     - CeleryExecutor: Distributes tasks across multiple worker nodes using Celery
     - KubernetesExecutor: Dynamically launches pods for each task on Kubernetes
     - DaskExecutor: Uses Dask distributed clusters for task execution

4. **Web Server**

   - Provides a user-friendly UI to monitor and manage workflows
   - Visualizes DAG structure and dependencies
   - Shows historical runs, logs, and task status
   - Allows manual triggering, pausing, and resuming of DAGs
   - Exposes a REST API for programmatic interaction

5. **DAG Directory**
   - Contains Python files defining the workflows
   - Scanned periodically by the scheduler for changes
   - Enables version control and collaboration through standard code practices

                                        └─────────────┘
```

## How Airflow Works

Airflow's operation follows a straightforward yet powerful workflow model:

1. **DAG Definition**

   - Users define DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in Python
   - Each DAG represents a collection of tasks with their dependencies
   - Example:

     ```python
     with DAG('example_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
              schedule_interval='@daily') as dag:
         task_1 = PythonOperator(task_id='extract', python_callable=extract_data)
         task_2 = PythonOperator(task_id='transform', python_callable=transform_data)
         task_3 = PythonOperator(task_id='load', python_callable=load_data)

         # Define dependencies
         task_1 >> task_2 >> task_3
     ```

2. **DAG Parsing**

   - Scheduler parses DAG files to create DAG objects
   - DAGs are stored in the metadata database
   - The scheduler determines which DAGs need to be run based on their schedule

3. **Task Scheduling**

   - When a DAG run is created, task instances are created for each task
   - The scheduler monitors task dependencies
   - When all upstream dependencies are met, tasks are queued for execution

4. **Task Execution**

   - Executor picks up queued tasks and distributes them to workers
   - Workers execute the tasks and report status back to the metadata database
   - Tasks can run in parallel if dependencies allow

5. **Monitoring and Management**
   - Web server provides real-time visibility into task/DAG status
   - Users can monitor progress, view logs, and troubleshoot issues
   - REST API enables programmatic control and integration

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks in Airflow follow a defined lifecycle with multiple possible states:

1. **No Status**

   - Initial state before the scheduler processes the task
   - No record exists in the metadata database yet

2. **Scheduled**

   - Task has been scheduled for execution
   - Waiting for the executor to pick it up

3. **Queued**

   - Task has been sent to the executor
   - Waiting for a worker to execute it

4. **Running**

   - Task is currently being executed by a worker
   - Logs are being generated and stored

5. **Success**

   - Task completed successfully
   - Downstream tasks can now be triggered

6. **Failed**

   - Task execution ended with an error
   - Can trigger failure callbacks or notifications
   - May prevent downstream tasks from running

7. **Retrying**

   - Task failed but has remaining retry attempts
   - Will be rescheduled based on retry policy

8. **Skipped**

   - Task was intentionally skipped (e.g., by a conditional operator)
   - Not considered failed or successful for dependency purposes

9. **Up for Reschedule**

   - Special state for sensors that didn't meet their criteria
   - Task will be rescheduled to check again later

10. **Upstream Failed**

    - Task wasn't run because an upstream dependency failed
    - Won't be attempted until the upstream task succeeds

11. **Removed**
    - Task exists in the database but is no longer in the DAG
    - Usually happens when DAG definitions change

## Advantages of Airflow

Airflow offers numerous advantages that have made it the industry standard for workflow orchestration:

### Advantages of Representing Data Pipelines as DAGs

1. **Clarity and Visualization**

   - DAGs provide a clear visual representation of workflow dependencies
   - Complex processes become easier to understand and communicate
   - The graph structure helps quickly identify bottlenecks or optimization opportunities

2. **Parallel Execution**

   - Tasks without interdependencies can run in parallel
   - Maximizes resource utilization and minimizes overall execution time
   - Enables high-throughput processing for large-scale data operations

3. **Failure Isolation**

   - Failures are isolated to specific tasks without necessarily failing the entire workflow
   - Failed tasks can be retried independently without rerunning the entire pipeline
   - Allows for targeted debugging and troubleshooting

4. **Incremental Processing**

   - Only affected downstream tasks need to be rerun when a task changes
   - Enables efficient backfilling of historical data
   - Supports incremental data processing patterns

5. **Workflow Composability**

   - Complex workflows can be built by combining simpler workflows
   - Encourages reusable, modular components
   - Facilitates standardization across teams and projects

6. **Dependency Management**

   - Explicit dependencies ensure proper task sequencing
   - Prevents race conditions and data consistency issues
   - Makes resource dependencies clear and manageable

7. **Scheduling Flexibility**
   - DAGs can be scheduled with complex time-based rules
   - Supports event-based triggers and external dependencies
   - Allows for conditional execution paths based on runtime conditions

### Scalability

- Handles workflows with thousands of tasks
- Distributes workloads across multiple workers
- Supports horizontal scaling through Celery or Kubernetes
- Processes millions of task instances efficiently
- Manages complex dependency trees without performance degradation

### Extensibility

- **Custom Operators**: Create specialized task types for specific use cases
- **Custom Hooks**: Build reusable connections to external systems
- **Custom Executors**: Implement custom task distribution logic
- **Plugins**: Extend the web UI and add new features
- **Provider Packages**: Community-maintained integrations with external systems

### Flexibility

- Define workflows using Python code, not restrictive YAML or XML
- Implement complex business logic and conditional branching
- Use dynamic task generation based on runtime parameters
- Create task dependencies using multiple approaches:

  ```python
  # Method 1: Bitshift operators
  task_1 >> task_2 >> task_3

  # Method 2: set_upstream/set_downstream
  task_3.set_upstream(task_2)
  task_2.set_upstream(task_1)

  # Method 3: List syntax with chain
  from airflow.models.baseoperator import chain
  chain(task_1, task_2, task_3)
  ```

### Rich User Interface

- Visualize DAG structure and dependencies in an intuitive graph view
- Monitor task execution in real-time with color-coded status indicators
- View detailed logs directly in the browser
- Track historical performance and execution times
- Manage connections, variables, and XComs through the UI
- Trigger, pause, or clear DAG runs with a few clicks

Since DAGs and workflows are defined in Python, you can use all the power of Python to define your workflows. You can use any Python library, and you can even call external APIs or services. Plus, since its code, you can maintain, version, collaborate and test your workflows just like any other code!

## Python-Based Workflow Definition

Airflow's Python-centric approach provides powerful capabilities that distinguish it from other workflow tools:

### Leveraging Python's Ecosystem

- **Library Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate thousands of Python packages

  ```python
  # Using pandas for data transformation
  def transform_data(**context):
      import pandas as pd
      df = pd.read_csv('/tmp/raw_data.csv')
      # Apply transformations
      df['processed'] = df['raw_value'] * 1.5
      df.to_csv('/tmp/processed_data.csv')
  ```

- **API Interaction**: Connect with external services using Python clients

  ```python
  def fetch_weather_data(**context):
      import requests
      response = requests.get(
          'https://api.weather.gov/points/39.7456,-97.0892',
          headers={'Accept': 'application/json'}
      )
      return response.json()
  ```

- **Advanced Data Processing**: Utilize scientific and ML libraries
  ```python
  def train_model(**context):
      from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
      from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
      X, y = make_classification()
      clf = RandomForestClassifier()
      clf.fit(X, y)
      # Save model
      import joblib
      joblib.dump(clf, '/tmp/model.joblib')
  ```

### Software Development Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Store DAGs in Git repositories

  - Track changes over time
  - Revert to previous versions if needed
  - Collaborate with team members through PRs
  - Enforce code reviews before deployment

- **Testing**: Create unit and integration tests for workflows

  ```python
  # test_dag.py
  import unittest
  from airflow.models import DagBag

  class TestMyDAG(unittest.TestCase):
      def test_dag_loaded(self):
          dagbag = DagBag()
          dag = dagbag.get_dag('my_dag')
          self.assertIsNotNone(dag)
          self.assertEqual(len(dag.tasks), 5)
          self.assertEqual(dagbag.import_errors, {})
  ```

- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate deployment of DAGs

  - Validate DAGs syntax before deployment
  - Run tests automatically on commit
  - Deploy to staging then production environments
  - Monitor DAG performance after changes

- **Modularization**: Create reusable components

  ```python
  # In a shared module: common_tasks.py
  def create_data_quality_check(table_name, sql_check):
      return SQLCheckOperator(
          task_id=f'check_{table_name}',
          sql=sql_check,
          conn_id='my_database'
      )

  # In your DAG file
  from common_tasks import create_data_quality_check

  check_orders = create_data_quality_check(
      'orders',
      'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_date IS NULL'
  )
  ```

### Dynamic Workflow Generation

- **Parameterized DAGs**: Create templates for similar workflows

  ```python
  for database in ['customers', 'orders', 'products']:
      extract_task = PythonOperator(
          task_id=f'extract_{database}',
          python_callable=extract_data,
          op_kwargs={'database': database}
      )
      transform_task = PythonOperator(
          task_id=f'transform_{database}',
          python_callable=transform_data,
          op_kwargs={'database': database}
      )
      extract_task >> transform_task >> load_task
  ```

- **Configuration as Code**: Store workflow configurations in Python

  ```python
  # config.py
  ETL_CONFIG = {
      'customers': {
          'source': 'mysql',
          'destination': 'bigquery',
          'transformations': ['normalize', 'deduplicate']
      },
      'orders': {
          'source': 'api',
          'destination': 'bigquery',
          'transformations': ['validate', 'aggregate']
      }
  }

  # dag.py
  from config import ETL_CONFIG

  for entity, config in ETL_CONFIG.items():
      # Create dynamic tasks based on configuration
  ```

- **Runtime Task Generation**: Create tasks based on previous task outputs
  ```python
  def create_processing_tasks(**context):
      tables = context['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='discover_tables')
      for table in tables:
          process_task = PythonOperator(
              task_id=f'process_{table}',
              python_callable=process_table,
              op_kwargs={'table': table},
              dag=context['dag']
          )
          # Set dependencies
          discover_task >> process_task >> complete_task
  ```

## Platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows

Airflow provides a comprehensive platform for the entire workflow lifecycle:

### Authoring Workflows

- **Code-First Approach**: Define workflows in Python for maximum flexibility
- **Web UI DAG Creation**: Some deployments support UI-based DAG creation
- **Template System**: Use Jinja templating for dynamic task parameters

  ```python
  templated_command = """
  {% for i in range(5) %}
      echo "{{ ds }}"
      echo "{{ macros.ds_add(ds, 7) }}"
      echo "{{ params.my_param }}"
  {% endfor %}
  """

  t1 = BashOperator(
      task_id='templated',
      bash_command=templated_command,
      params={'my_param': 'Parameter I passed in'},
  )
  ```

- **Variable System**: Store and retrieve configuration values

  ```python
  from airflow.models import Variable

  api_key = Variable.get("api_key", deserialize_json=True)
  ```

- **Connection Management**: Securely store and use connection credentials

  ```python
  from airflow.hooks.base_hook import BaseHook

  conn = BaseHook.get_connection('my_postgres_conn')
  ```

### Scheduling Capabilities

- **Cron-like Scheduling**: Familiar syntax for time-based scheduling
  ```python
  # Run at 10:00 PM every day
  dag = DAG('example', schedule_interval='0 22 * * *')
  ```
- **Preset Intervals**: Human-readable interval definitions
  ```python
  # Options include: @once, @hourly, @daily, @weekly, @monthly, @yearly
  dag = DAG('example', schedule_interval='@daily')
  ```
- **Custom Intervals**: Define intervals using datetime objects

  ```python
  from datetime import timedelta

  dag = DAG('example', schedule_interval=timedelta(hours=6))
  ```

- **Event-Triggered**: Trigger DAGs based on external events (with sensors)
- **Backfilling**: Automatically run missed intervals when catching up
  ```python
  # Will backfill all missed runs since January 1, 2023
  dag = DAG(
      'example',
      start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
      schedule_interval='@daily',
      catchup=True
  )
  ```

### Monitoring Capabilities

- **DAG Visualization**: Interactive graph representation of workflow structure
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of task and DAG status
- **Historical Views**: Access to all previous runs and their outcomes
- **Log Inspection**: View logs directly in the UI
  - Stream logs in real-time during execution
  - Download logs for offline analysis
- **Metrics and Analytics**: Track performance metrics over time
  - Task duration
  - Success/failure rates
  - Resource utilization
- **Alerting**: Configure notifications for failures or SLA misses
  ```python
  default_args = {
      'email': ['team@example.com'],
      'email_on_failure': True,
      'email_on_retry': False,
      'sla': timedelta(hours=2),
      'sla_miss_callback': notify_sla_miss
  }
  ```

### Management Features

- **Manual Triggers**: Run DAGs on-demand regardless of schedule
- **Task Reruns**: Retry specific failed tasks without rerunning the entire DAG
- **DAG Pausing**: Temporarily disable DAGs without deleting them
- **Clear Task Instances**: Reset task state to rerun them
- **Mark Success/Failure**: Manually override task status
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for different user types
  - Viewer: Can only view DAGs and their status
  - User: Can trigger DAGs but not modify them
  - Op: Can perform administrative functions
  - Admin: Full control over all Airflow features

## How the Airflow Scheduler Executes Tasks

The Airflow Scheduler is a critical component responsible for orchestrating task execution according to defined dependencies and schedules. Here's how it works:

### Scheduler Process Flow

1. **DAG Parsing and Processing**

   - The scheduler continually scans the DAG directory for Python files
   - Each DAG file is parsed to create DAG objects in memory
   - The scheduler evaluates which DAGs need to be scheduled based on their schedule_interval
   - DAG runs are created for each scheduling period that hasn't been processed yet

2. **Task Instance Creation**

   - For each DAG run, task instances are created for every task in the DAG
   - Task instances are initially in the "no_status" state
   - The scheduler determines the execution order based on dependencies

3. **Dependency Resolution**

   - Before scheduling a task, the scheduler checks if all upstream dependencies are met
   - This includes both task dependencies within the same DAG run and potentially cross-DAG dependencies
   - Only tasks with all dependencies satisfied are considered for execution

4. **Task Scheduling**

   - Tasks ready for execution are set to the "scheduled" state
   - The scheduler then queues these tasks for execution
   - Priority weights are considered to determine execution order when resources are limited

5. **Task Distribution**

   - The scheduler hands off queued tasks to the executor
   - The executor is responsible for distributing tasks to available workers
   - Different executor types handle task distribution differently:
     - LocalExecutor: Runs tasks in parallel processes on a single machine
     - CeleryExecutor: Distributes tasks across multiple worker nodes
     - KubernetesExecutor: Dynamically provisions pods for each task

6. **State Tracking**

   - The scheduler continuously monitors the state of all task instances
   - When tasks complete (success or failure), dependent tasks are re-evaluated
   - Failed tasks may be retried based on the retry configuration

7. **Backfilling and Catchup**
   - The scheduler can process historical time periods (backfilling)
   - When a new DAG is added or a DAG's schedule is changed, catchup can process missed intervals
   - This is controlled by the catchup parameter in the DAG definition

### Scheduler Performance Considerations

- The scheduler is single-threaded but can process multiple DAGs concurrently
- For large deployments, multiple scheduler instances can be run behind a load balancer
- The parsing of DAG files can be resource-intensive, especially for complex DAGs
- Using SubDagOperator can lead to potential deadlocks and is generally discouraged
- Scheduler performance can be optimized through:
  - Efficient DAG design
  - Proper database indexing
  - Appropriate executor configuration
  - Strategic use of pools to manage resource allocation

## Benefits of Defining Workflows as Code

Airflow's approach of defining workflows as Python code offers significant advantages over configuration-based systems:

### Programmatic Flexibility

## List common use cases

Airflow excels in a variety of data orchestration scenarios across industries. Here are the most common use cases:

### ETL/ELT Data Pipelines

Airflow's most common application is orchestrating data movement and transformation:

1. **Traditional ETL Workflows**

   - Extract data from multiple sources
   - Transform data using various processing frameworks
   - Load data into data warehouses or data lakes
   - Example:

     ```python
     extract_task = PythonOperator(
         task_id='extract_from_mysql',
         python_callable=extract_mysql_data,
     )

     transform_task = SparkSubmitOperator(
         task_id='transform_with_spark',
         application='/jobs/transformation.py',
         conn_id='spark',
     )

     load_task = S3ToRedshiftOperator(
         task_id='load_to_redshift',
         schema='public',
         table='customers',
         s3_bucket='data-lake',
         s3_key='transformed/customers.csv',
         copy_options=['CSV'],
     )

     extract_task >> transform_task >> load_task
     ```

2. **Modern ELT Pipelines**

```python
with DAG(
    'ecommerce_daily_analytics',
    schedule_interval='0 1 * * *',  # Run at 1 AM daily
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
) as dag:

    # Wait for transaction data to be available
    check_transaction_data = FileSensor(
        task_id='check_transaction_data',
        filepath='/data/transactions/{{ ds }}.csv',
        poke_interval=300,  # Check every 5 minutes
        timeout=60 * 60 * 2,  # Timeout after 2 hours
    )

    # Load transactions into staging
    load_transactions = PythonOperator(
        task_id='load_transactions',
        python_callable=load_transactions_to_staging,
        op_kwargs={'date': '{{ ds }}'},
    )

    # Load customer data from API

        task_id='check_api_availability',
        http_conn_id='customer_api',
        endpoint='health',
        response_check=lambda response: response.status_code == 200,
        poke_interval=60,
        timeout=60 * 30,
    ) >> PythonOperator(
        task_id='fetch_customer_data',
        python_callable=fetch_customers,
    )

    # Transform and aggregate data
    transform_data = SparkSubmitOperator(
        task_id='transform_data',
        application='/jobs/transform_ecommerce.py',
        application_args=['--date', '{{ ds }}'],
        conn_id='spark',
    )

    # Load to data warehouse
    load_to_warehouse = PostgresOperator(
        task_id='load_to_warehouse',
        sql="""
        INSERT INTO sales_facts
        SELECT * FROM staging.processed_sales
        WHERE date = '{{ ds }}';
        """,
        postgres_conn_id='data_warehouse',
    )

    # Update dashboards
    refresh_dashboards = HttpOperator(
        task_id='refresh_dashboards',
        http_conn_id='tableau_api',
        endpoint='refreshes',
        method='POST',
        data=json.dumps({
            "dashboard_id": "sales-overview",
            "refresh_type": "full"
        }),
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    )

    # Send report to stakeholders
    send_report = EmailOperator(
        task_id='send_daily_report',
        to=['sales@example.com', 'marketing@example.com'],
        subject='Daily Sales Report - {{ ds }}',
        html_content='<h3>Daily Sales Report</h3><p>Attached is the daily sales report.</p>',
        files=['/reports/daily_{{ ds }}.pdf'],
    )

    # Define the workflow
    check_transaction_data >> load_transactions
    [load_transactions, fetch_customer_data] >> transform_data >> load_to_warehouse
    load_to_warehouse >> [refresh_dashboards, send_report]
```

This workflow demonstrates how Airflow can coordinate complex multi-system data orchestration, incorporating sensors, various operators, error handling, and parallel task execution.

     # In a file that will be imported by Airflow
     def create_data_pipeline_dag(source_system, tables):
         dag_id = f"etl_{source_system}"

         with DAG(dag_id, schedule_interval='@daily', ...) as dag:
             for table in tables:
                 extract = PythonOperator(
                     task_id=f"extract_{table}",
                     python_callable=extract_table,
                     op_kwargs={'system': source_system, 'table': table},
                 )
                 # ... more tasks

         return dag

     # Create multiple DAGs
     for source in config['sources']:
         globals()[f"etl_{source['name']}"] = create_data_pipeline_dag(
             source['name'],
             source['tables']
         )
     ```
